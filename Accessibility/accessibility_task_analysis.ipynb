    "### Tool Definition Formatting\n",
    "For me to use a tool, you need to define it in the following JSON format. This specifies the tool's name, description, and input parameters (using JSON Schema):\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"name\": \"tool_name\",\n",
    "  \"description\": \"Clear explanation of when to use this tool\",\n",
    "  \"parameters\": {\n",
    "    \"type\": \"object\",\n",
    "    \"properties\": {\n",
    "      \"param1\": {\n",
    "        \"type\": \"string/number/boolean/array/object\",\n",
    "        \"description\": \"Purpose of this parameter\"\n",

    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Notes:\n",
    "1. **`name`**: Unique identifier for the tool (e.g., `get_weather`).  \n",
    "2. **`description`**: Explains **when** the tool should be used (critical for accurate invocation).  \n",
    "3. **`parameters`**: Defines inputs using [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/):\n",
    "   - `type`: Data type (`string`, `number`, `boolean`, `array`, `object`).  \n",
    "   - `description`: Clarifies the parameter's purpose.  \n",
    "   - `required`: List mandatory parameters.  \n",
    "   - `additionalProperties: false`: Disallows extra parameters (recommended).  \n",

    "1. **`tool_name`**: Must match the defined tool name.  \n",
    "2. **`arguments`**: Contains **only** the parameters defined in the tool's schema.  \n",
    "   - Values respect data types (e.g., strings in quotes, numbers without quotes).  \n",
    "   - Omit optional parameters not provided by the user.  \n",
    "3. **No extra text**: The output is *pure JSON* without explanations or markdown.  \n",
